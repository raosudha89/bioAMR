As shown in Figure S1, histone 2B phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had high levels of incorporated 32P, suggesting that p38 SAPK was active; while under the same conditions, ASPP2 (693-1128) fragment phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had very low levels of incorporated 32P, indicating that p38 SAPK is not an efficient kinase for ASPP2 phosphorylation.
